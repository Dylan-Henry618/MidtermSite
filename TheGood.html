      <p>Indeed, it seems too  good to be true and maybe it is, but I'm not going to critisize an <b>actual</b> good game. And with the sequel on the way too...</p>

      <p>Seriously this wasn't considered best game of 2019 for nothing, and what do you know, it's an original idea! I know it's really hard to come up with new ideas, but this by itself should be inspiration for others to make keep trying to make games that have an original idea even if the gameplay is very similar to other games. In this case Dark souls was the obvious influence but how it was evolved was very well done.</p>

      <p><b>Hell yeah, DOOM is back baby, and you already know people are excited for when DOOM Eternal is going to drop. As one of the fathers of shooters, DOOM really does deserve to have some love when it come to reimaginings. Wolfenstein isn't bad either, but I just think when we think of games that really tried to stick to it's roots, I think that this game just really tried making you feel like you are really the one thing the beings in hell fear and it's so much fun being that way.</b></p>

    <p>Probably could have made an entire page on this series alone with how underrated it is, but honestly who cares? Dante's back baby! This took everything that was awesome from previous games and just made it so much better. Combat has to be the smoothest of any fighting game, and the music. Perfection doesn't describe it better. Devil Trigger is still a <b>BADA$$</b> beat. And they did't have to do this, but as you do better in game, the music gets better. Like come on, I don't want to be a Capcom fanboy but just ooooooooh baby, Let's Rock!</p>
</div>

    <p>Seriously though, these are games that we should inspiration to. Adding onto a game and just showing that as a developer you really are inspired to make this game because you actually like it and not for financial reasons.</p>
